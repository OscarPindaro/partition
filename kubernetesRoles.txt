Normally the partition placed int he container doesnt have permissions to read and update resources from the kubernetes API.
In order to solve this:

-> kubectl create -f NodeRole
-> kubectl create <binding-nome> --clusterrole=<nameInNodeRole> --user=<partitionUser>

in this case, the user should be openfaas-fn:deafult (you can read it in the exception rased by the container with error code 503)
